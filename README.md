# Vanilla Machine Learning Projects 🧠⚙️

This repository is a comprehensive collection of **vanilla machine learning projects**, with a strong focus on **building algorithms from scratch using NumPy** and understanding the **core mathematics and intuition behind ML models**.

The goal of this repo is **learning-first**, not just using libraries as black boxes.

## 🔍 What I Focused On

- Implementing ML algorithms **from scratch using NumPy**
- Understanding the **math, intuition, and workflow** behind each model
- Comparing **from-scratch implementations vs library-based approaches**
- Keeping the code **clean, modular, and readable**
- Deploying one end-to-end ML project using **Streamlit**
