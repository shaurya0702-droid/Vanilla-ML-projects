💻 Descriptive Question: Binary SVM Classification from Scratch using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
You are required to implement a Binary Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier from scratch using only NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn (no machine learning libraries like scikit-learn).
The aim is to understand and demonstrate how SVM works mathematically and programmatically, including data import, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization.

1. Dataset Import and EDA
Select a simple real-world tabular dataset with a binary target (e.g., bank marketing, loan approval, or create a synthetic 2D dataset).

Load the dataset using Pandas.

Perform basic EDA:

Display dataset shape, summary statistics, and check for missing values.

Visualize feature and target distributions (histograms, scatterplots, pairplots).

Explore relationships between key features and the target.

Discuss observations briefly.

2. Data Preparation
Encode categorical features if needed.

Select two numerical features for visualization and simplicity.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Apply feature scaling (standardization) to all numerical features.





3. Manual SVM Implementation
Implement a hard-margin linear SVM for binary classification using NumPy:

Write the optimization loop to find model weights (w) and bias (b).

Define the SVM decision function and prediction logic.

Track and print the loss (hinge loss or simple misclassification error) during training.

4. Model Training, Prediction & Evaluation
Train your SVM on the training data.

Use the trained model to predict labels on the test set.

Evaluate performance using accuracy (percentage correct) and visual confusion matrix.

Report learned weights, bias, and number of support vectors (if possible).





5. Visualization
Plot the data points, SVM decision boundary, and support vectors in 2D (Matplotlib/Seaborn).

Visualize misclassified points.

Plot the loss curve (error vs iteration) to show how your model learns.






6. Implementation Platform
Complete the notebook in Google Colab.

Use Markdown cells to clearly explain math, logic, and each code step.

7. Expected Understanding
By the end of this project, you should:

Understand the geometric and mathematical foundation of SVM classification.

See how SVM separates classes using linear algebra and optimization.

Appreciate why SVM is different from linear regression and other classifiers.

Gain practical experience with full ML workflow: data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.
